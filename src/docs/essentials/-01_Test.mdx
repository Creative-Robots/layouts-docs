## Intro

The syntax we use in Layouts is different from HTML or JSX. See why [here](essentials/What%20is%20Layouts#concise-syntax-to-help-you-focus-on-what-matters).
Fear not! We decided to keep as close to the original, so it works just the same. ðŸ˜Ž

Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

### Tabs and `/` instead of XML components.

  Instead of writing: 
  ``` HTML HTML
  <div class="bg-indigo-100" >
	<button>
		Hello
	</button>
</div>
```
You write: 
```syntax Layouts
/div bg-indigo-100
	/button Hello
```
### Works with (included) React components or any HTML component.

Any HTML component like `/div` or `/section` will work like: 

```syntax Layouts
/div Hello!
```


### Variables
  
Layouts uses a simplified syntax for using variables with components.
- All variable names are prefixed with `$`
- Adding a variable name on a component line binds the variable to the component
- Adding the variable name in props or as content uses the variable value there

**Here's an example:**
```
  /input $name Whatâ€™s your name?  
  /h1 Hello $name !
```

You can also load data from external sources into variables
See the specific section about data sources [here](essentials/datasources)

  **ex. Data Source**
    ```syntax Layouts
    /data $movies = mock://movies with title and poster
    /div w-full overflow-x-scroll
    	/hstack bg-slate-950 gap-5 p-4 text-white items-start w-fit
    		/foreach $movies
    			/vstack gap-3 %center justify-start
    				/div w-32
    					/aspect-ratio %video-portrait overflow-hidden
    						/image $item.poster size-full object-cover rounded hover:scale-105 cursor-pointer
    				/center $item.title w-full text-center text-sm
    ```
