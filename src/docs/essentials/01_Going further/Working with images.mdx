In Layouts, users can leverage AI or access various asset libraries to generate various types of images, modify them on the fly with modifiers, and change an image's aspect ratio, radius etc.

### Images

The `/image` component in Layouts fetches an image from the internet or from your favorite asset libraries.

**ex:**
```syntax Layouts
/image %unsplash spaceship size-48 rounded-lg
```

### Using image variants

If you'd like to set more constraints on where the image is sourced and how you'd like it to be generated, use the `%variant` to set constraints.

For instance, if you'd like to find an image of a tiger from Google images, use the `/image` component followed by `%google` on the same line.

**ex.**
``` syntax Layouts
/image %google tiger
```

Use the `/icon` component in Layouts whenever you need to use a icon in your design. All icons in Layouts are made available via [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/).

For example, if your looking for a rocket icon for your primary `/button` on a landing page, nest the `/icon` component as a child under the button. On the same line as your `/icon` component, type in what you need and we'll find the icon most relevant based on your description. 

**ex.**
```
/button %default
	/icon rocket 
	/p Get started 
```

### Illustrations

Use the `/illustration` component if you need to use an illustration in your design. 
For instance, if you've ever needed a minimalist illustration for a landing page, you can use the `/illustration` component and `%minimalistic` variant. On that same line, type in what you need and weâ€™ll find the most relevant illustration based on your description.

**ex.**
``` syntax Layouts
/div flex flex-col items-center p-12
	/illustration %minimalistic video call
```
Other available variants for illustrations include: 
| Illustration variants  |
| -------- |
| %kukla-angle
| %kukla-face
| %flatline
| %isometric 
| %monochromatic
| %outline
| %two-color 
| %minimalistic
