All pre-made components in Layouts are built around a central design system.
This makes the design of your page easily customizable to your brand needs, and your code resilient to eventual future design system changes.

Changing the theme of your page is as easy as adding a `/theme` component.
It enables you to change the radius of elements, the colors and we hope a few more things in the future. 


### Theme variables

Here is an example with all theme variables you can set:
```syntax Layouts
/theme
  @colorScheme="light" // Light or dark mode
    @radius="0.5rem" // Border radius for card, input, and buttons
    @background="primary-50" // Color overrides
    @accent="#00ff00"
    @foreground="slate-900"
    @muted="slate-100"
    @mutedForeground="slate-800"
    @card="white"
    @cardForeground="slate-900"
    @popover="white"
    @popoverForeground="slate-900"
    @border="slate-200"
    @input="slate-100"
    @primary="blue-600"
    @primaryForeground="white"
    @secondary="blue-200"
    @secondaryForeground="blue-800"
    @accent="green-800"
    @accentForeground="white"
    @destructive="red-600"
    @destructiveForeground="white"
    @ring="blue-600"
```

### AI-generated palette

To use a color palette generated by AI in your project's theme, you'll include the `@palette` prop in your `/theme`: 

```syntax Layouts
/theme
  @palette=Intense Mediterranean turquoise as primary, creamy white in background
```

To override palette colors provided by the AI: 
```syntax Layouts
/theme
    @palette=Intense Mediterranean turquoise as primary, creamy white in background
    @background="primary-50" // Color overrides
```

Sometimes, you need to change the default style of a component, either on a full website/app or within a specific section.
You can use `/style` for that. `/style` is a component that applies Tailwind classes to its parent's descendants. Use this component to customize font, colors and more across your project.

**ex:**
```syntax Layouts
/style
    /h1 font-['Jersey_10'] text-8xl

/h1 Hello, styles!
```

### Fonts 
Need custom fonts? In Layouts, users can leverage fonts via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as well as any fonts hosted locally on your machine. 

**ex.**
``` syntax Layouts
/div flex flex-col p-2 items-center border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow-sm
    /p This is a card font-['Roboto'] text-xl font-semibold
```

<Info> Heads up! You’ll be tempted to export your project using your local fonts not available in Google Fonts, because they’ll seem to work on your machine. 
Bear in mind that they won’t display correctly on other people’s navigators when sharing your Layouts URL, so you'll still need to add your custom font to your CSS file after exporting.</Info>
