## How to contact support and access additional resources

You figured it out. Layouts is not a finished product polished at every angle.
It’s very raw, a bit buggy. We throwed it out into the wild to get feedback from people like you.

We’d love you to get in touch and tell us how you feel about it. 

Here are a few channels below on how to best reach out:

 
### Contact support
Reach out to Layouts.dev support by contacting us directly at support@layouts.dev.

**or**

By getting in touch with us on the dedicated _Contact us_ link on our website.

### Community 

We recommend joining the Layouts.dev Discord channel to meet other Layouts users and exchange tips/tricks. 
The whole Layouts team lives in the Discord so it's a great place to ask questions, get support, connect with the team and other users in the community. 

The community is also a great place to report bugs in #help-and-support or feedback in #ideas-and-feedback.

## Contribute 

If you’re interested in contributing, we’d love to have you onboard!
Here are a few ways:

    **Giving feedback**:
        - Feel free to contribute feedback on our Discord (see above for notes on where to best submit feedback).
    
    **Joining the team**: 
        - We’re a small company looking for funding, but we’ll certainly be hiring very soon. We’d love to get in touch beforehand so we can contact you. Feel free to send us an email at hey@layouts.dev
   
    **Investing**: 
        - Money (Capital at Risk): We believe in the power of community investing. We currently have an open SAFE in place for people wanting to invest. Anybody can send funds and you’ll be added to our SAFE as an investor. Works for contributions starting at $5k and beyond.
        - Time: If you don’t have money (like a lot of us) but feel you could contribute time as a team member, we’re super open to talk. We can compensate you with a great pay rate in shares on our SAFE. It’s just shares, but hey, we’re aiming for the stars!
