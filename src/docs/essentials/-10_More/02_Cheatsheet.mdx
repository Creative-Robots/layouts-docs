# Intro 
**Layouts** is like a playground for Tailwind CSS. <br /> You write something on the left and it displays on the right. **That simple**. <br /> The only difference is that we use a more concise syntax than HTML to improve developer experience.

For example, instead of writing:

```html
<div class="bg-indigo-100">
  <button>
    Hello
  </button>
</div>
```

You would write:

```
/div bg-indigo-100
  /button Hello
```

# Basic Syntax
```
/component %variant @property1=value @property2=value2 tailwind-class tailwind-class .css-class Text content
  /child-component Text content
    /grand-child-component Another text here
```

<br />
---
<br />

# Add a Component
Write `/` and select the component in the menu.

<br />
---
<br />

# Get an example of use for your component
```
/button >>>
```
Type `>>>` after your component name.  

<br />
---
<br />

# Select component variants
```
/button %variantName
```
Place your caret over the variant name and press `Shift + Up` or `Shift + Down`.

<br />
---
<br />

# Style a Component with Tailwind Classes
```
/h1 Hello world text-6xl underline m-4
```
Add the tailwind classes on the same line as the component.
<br />
Iterate on values by placing your caret over the tailwind class and pressing `Shift + Up` or `Shift + Down`.

# Ask AI for the Right Tailwind Classes
```
/h1 Hello (I'd like the text to have a gradient background clipped to it...)
```
Describe what you need in the following format: `(<DESCRIPTION HERE>...)`

<br />

# Add an Image of an Icon
```
/image Tiger
/icon Chevron left
```

<br />

<br />

# Add a Global Style for a Component
```
/style
  /button bg-indigo-900
```

<br />
---
<br />

# Change the Global Theme for the App

```
/theme 
  @primaryColor=indigo-800
  @radius="2em"
```
