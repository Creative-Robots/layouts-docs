## Intro

The syntax we use in Layouts is different from HTML or JSX. See why [here](essentials/What%20is%20Layouts#concise-syntax-to-help-you-focus-on-what-matters).
Fear not! We decided to keep as close to the original, so it works just the same. 😎

Here’s what you need to know:

### Tabs and `/` instead of XML components.

	Instead of writing: 
	``` HTML HTML
	<div class="bg-indigo-100" >
	<button>
		Hello
	</button>
</div>
```
You write: 
```syntax Layouts
/div bg-indigo-100
	/button Hello
```
### Works with (included) React components or any HTML component.

Any HTML component like `/div` or `/section` will work like: 

```syntax Layouts
/div Hello!
```
### Tailwind classes are first-class citizens

Any Tailwind class you input will be detected and used as a class name for the component on the same line: 
```syntax Layouts
/button bg-indigo-100
```
Is the same as: 
```HTML HTML
<button className="bg-indigo-100" />
```
<Info>Tailwind classes can live on the same line as the `/component` or as a child of the component, on a line 
with only Tailwind classes.</Info>

**Here's an example:**
```syntax Layouts
/button 
	bg-indigo-100 font-medium text-xl 
	This works too
```

### Props with `@`

Use:
```syntax Layouts
/button @onClick={() => alert ('Haha!')}
```
Instead of:
```HTML HTML
<button onClick={() => alert('Haha!')} />
```
<Info>Props can live either on the same line as the `/component`, or nested as a child with one prop per line.</Info>

**Here's an example:**
```syntax Layouts
/button 
	@onClick={() => alert('Haha!')}
	This works too
```

### Variables
	
Layouts uses a simplified syntax for using variables with components.
- All variable names are prefixed with `$`
- Adding a variable name on a component line binds the variable to the component
- Adding the variable name in props or as content uses the variable value there

**Here's an example:**
```
/input $name What’s your name?	
/h1 Hello $name !
```

You can also load data from external sources into variables
See the specific section about data sources [here](essentials/datasources)

	**ex. Data Source**
```syntax Layouts
/data $movies = mock://movies with title and poster
/div w-full overflow-x-scroll
	/hstack bg-slate-950 gap-5 p-4 text-white items-start w-fit
		/foreach $movies
			/vstack gap-3 %center justify-start
				/div w-32
					/aspect-ratio %video-portrait overflow-hidden
						/image $item.poster size-full object-cover rounded hover:scale-105 cursor-pointer
				/center $item.title w-full text-center text-sm
```

### Short vs. Composable Syntax
On one hand, a great developer experience should enable you to build something at the speed of light.
On the other hand, it should give you unobstructed control over the tiniest details of each component.
To give you both, most components built in Layouts are usable with two types of syntax.

The short syntax is what you will use when you need great default and little customization.
It’s the syntax we use most of the time in reference implementations.
It’s made to be as easy to use as MDX and super intuitive _(hopefully...feedback welcome!)_
		
**ex. Context Menu**
```syntax Short Syntax
/context-menu
	Menu item 1 <Alt 1>
	Menu item 2
		# Label
		Sub-menu item 1 <Shift P>
		---
		Sub-menu item 2 <Cmd S>
```

**Composable syntax** is what you’ll need when defaults don’t suit you, or if you need to surgically	
change the style of a specific element within your components.

		**ex. Context Menu**
```syntax Composable
/div Right click here flex h-[150px] w-[300px] items-center justify-center rounded-md border border-dashed text-sm
	/context-menu w-64 
		/item Back
		/shortcut 
			⌘
	/item Forward
		/shortcut ⌘]
		/item Reload
		/shortcut ⌘R
``` 

### Custom classes

When you find yourself having to break away from the design system to get your design right, consistent with TailwindCSS, you can use arbitrary values in your `/theme`, `/style` and across individal components.

For example, you can add some top-margin to a `/div` by using Tailwind’s square bracket notation to generate a class on any arbitrary value.

This works for everything, including things like text colors, font styles, pseudo-elements, and more.

**ex.**
```syntax Layouts
/div flex flex-row items-center mt-[200px]
	/h1 My avatar
	/avatar https://github.com/shadcn.png
		@fallback="CN"
```


### The `reset` class 

<video
	autoPlay
	muted
	loop
	playsInline
	className="w-full"
	src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5cugs917pnodymwdtopuc/reset-class.mp4?rlkey=z39ba1k80sm5smnuc46zlzeoy&st=c3e4y69p&dl=0"
></video>


The `reset` class in Layouts.dev is a powerful utility that removes all default styles from a component, allowing you to start with a clean slate for custom styling.

- Removes all pre-defined styles and behaviors
- Useful for creating highly customized components
- May affect functionality of complex components (e.g., dialogs)
- Use cautiously and re-apply necessary styles/properties as needed

**ex.**

``` Layout syntax 
/button reset flex flex-row items-center gap-2 border p-2
		/icon Visioconference
		/text Start meeting
```






### Variants

></video>

Many components in Layouts have an alternative version which can share many of the same visual and behavioral differences. 

For instance, if you're working with the `/alert` component in Layouts, you can quickly reference it's implementation (using `>>>`) and notice it's variant is set automatically set to `%default`.
To change a component's variant, you can either type it in manually, or (for ease of use), cycle thru available variants using your `Shift+Up, Shift+down` on your keyboard.

To look up a component's available variants, you can reference Layouts documentation via the Docs panel in navigation. 


### Summary 

After the `/component`, you can apply a number of different properties including:
		- Type any Tailwind classes and they’ll be recognized as such. For example, write `bg-indigo-900`
		- Type any other CSS class using the format `.customClassName`
		- Specify variants for components using `%variantName` syntax
		- Use custom classes across your `/theme`, `/style`, or individual components in Layouts like `/p-[24px]`.
		- Add props like `@type=button` or `@title=”Title with spaces”` which will be equivalent to HTML attributes like `<div type=”button” ></div>`
		- Bind a variable to a component by using `$variableName`
		- Any plain text will be recognized as a text-string and placed as a child of the component

	To summarize, type any valid HTML component and you can use any Tailwind class on it. Style away!
