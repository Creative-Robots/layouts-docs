## How to start

### Start coding
  <img height="full" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mx52yve3bydx9isfufif6/start-coding_QS_Layoutsdocs.gif?rlkey=5fa0sq6h7dlp56elu7lvtn6r8&st=lki3eq7i&dl=0" />

    - Open a new page
    - Write "Hello". _You should see "Hello" in preview_.
    - Open the Layouts preview on your mobile device using the QR code that appears when hovering over the **Preview** panel in navigation.
    - Write "again". You should now see "Hello again" in your mobile preview window.

### Start styling
  <img height="full" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zhvpmfmche12o1zppygy5/start-styling_QS_LayoutsDocs.gif?rlkey=mof2bk8dlvjha3k7i50685643&st=8eqstsox&dl=0" />
   - Now add `/div` and nest your text under it.
   - Add `text-xl` before or after it. This class will change the text size. Add some padding, a border, round corners, set a width that fits your text and a drop shadow to give your `/div` some space. 
  
  **ex.**
   ```syntax Layouts
    /div text-xl p-4 border rounded-xl shadow-md
      hello
   ```

   - Take your cursor and click on the Tailwind class `text-xl`. Using your keyboard press `Shift+Up` or `Shift+Down` to change the text size.
   
### Prompt-to-TailwindCSS 
   If you don't know all of the right Tailwind classes, AI can help with that.

   Prompt by typing `(your prompt goes here...)`
      - **ex.** `(I'd like my text to have a beautiful gradient clipped to it, from pink to purple...)`
   - The AI will generate and add all the necessary Tailwind classes to style your element.

### Adding images
<img height="full" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/x2xq8q7jim6t1a2gmrzdf/Image_QS_Layoutsdocs.gif?rlkey=e48b7eb6bppove3ffzal00enj&st=vx2kn9df&dl=0" />
  - Erase all the content from your page and write `/image Tiger`. You'll see an image of a Tiger populate in your preview.
  - Change the asset library your image comes from by using a variant. 
    - **ex.** `/image size-48 %google Tiger`.
         <Note>The default variant is `%unsplash`</Note>
  - You can also generate images with AI using variants. 
    - **ex.** `/image %ai/night-portrait handsome 22yo new york pizza delivery guy size-48`.

### Using components
<img height="full" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/apknne24w4qw0ridhilyd/Components_QS_Layoutsdocs.gif?rlkey=nmil3mb4uu5dl7bwjp4qh2nyi&st=ooimzy69&dl=0" />
  - Type `/`. 
  - Select any component from the slash menu. 
  - After the component name, type `>>>` to generate the component's reference implementation. 
  - To see different implementations for a component, click on the `/component` in the editor and open the Docs panel in navigation.  

### See code output
  - Open your code panel. 
  - Click on the 'Copy' button to copy-paste your code. 
  -  If your code has dependencies, the output code will contain comments to help you setup those dependencies easily.
