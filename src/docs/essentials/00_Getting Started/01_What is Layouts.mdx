    Layouts is a web editor we built for ourselves to ship interfaces and components at hyper-speed. It‚Äôs very opinionated, tailor-made for Tailwind and filled with features to make your idea to production journey way easier as a developer. We're currently in early beta, so lots of bugs, but we felt it‚Äôs important to build in public together with a community. 
    
    We‚Äôd love to get your feedback!

## Why use Layouts.dev?

**A notebook experience for Tailwind+React developers**

We love the idea of being able to open up a blank page, write a few lines of code and see the results instantly. 
With Layouts, every page you create gets a unique URL you can share instantly.
As fun to play with as a Tailwind playground, as shareable as a GitHub Gist.
No setup, no yarn install, no boilerplate, no deploy. Just play & share.

**A new way for designers to contribute to code**

We've found that by improving the DX in Layouts.dev, it has the potential to be a designer's bridge to the world of coding UI with high-quality, accessible and customizable code. Historically we've felt that drag-and-drop visual builders can constrain creativity vs. a code-focused approach, which means your creativity can truly be limitless.

Layouts.dev provides the intuitive visuals and frameworks that empower designers to directly build out front-end UI themselves vs. tossing designs over the wall for developers. We've all been there üòÆ‚Äçüí®. For designers familiar with CSS frameworks like Tailwind, Layouts can open up new levels of accessibility to the code layer.

Matter a fact, we've even used this internally to help speed up the development process by iterating quickly between our designer and developer for UI across Layouts. 

### Concise syntax to help you focus on what matters

At first glance, we admit this may look like a bad idea (alert! new programming language!), but we felt we needed something more readable and also way more permissive to ship UIs faster. So we built a DSL (Domain Specific Language) focused on assembling a UI with React+Tailwind.

It enables us to generate state-of-the-art React code from a more natural, very approximate input. This allows both for a short syntax using beautiful defaults and a composable syntax giving you very accurate control on the output React code, all while making the code up to 10x smaller and more readable.

>**Fun fact:** we created this language back in 2021 when trying to make apps using OpenAI's GPT-3. At that time, GPT-3 was so bad at React that we felt building a language for a lower intelligence was necessary. Then we figured out it actually contributed to a nicer DX for humans too, while drastically reducing both generation time and error rates of modern AI LLMs like GPT-4.

### Live multi-screen, multi-preview of what you're building

Anybody with a Layouts link can display your preview and see updates as you type.

Super useful for building responsive pages.

### Designed to be keyboard-first for fast iteration of Tailwind classes.

We designed Layouts in a way that leans into developer ergonomics, so you can use the keyboard to build quickly. 

### Tons of pre-made components to help you build complex UIs

Everything from accessible Dialog Boxes, Toggles and Buttons to Auto-Completes. We are huge fans of shadcn/ui, so we wanted to offer the full-library during Private Beta.

More component libraries coming soon! üéâ

### Basically, less context switching all over the place

Layouts displays contextual documentation when you click into any component, class, prop or attribute. It also fetches icons, illustrations and other image assets for you.

And you don‚Äôt need to setup a repository to make it work. **Voil√°**
