## The Editor 

 <img

  The editor is the core programming workspace in Layouts. It is where you'll be primarily living when making code changes. Start programming here to watch your design come to life. We've also built in some ergonomics here via keyboard shortcuts to help speed up your workflow.  

### Slash Menu

  src="/images/slash_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

By pressing `/` while in the editor, you can access all shadcn/UI components as well as HTML components which you can use to build your project.

### Explainer

When focused on any Tailwind class, use `Shift + Up` or `Shift + Down` to cycle thru corresponding Tailwind classes.

### Reference Implementation

To build even faster in your project, or get quick insight on how to best structure components, type `>>>` after a component tag to paste it’s reference implementation. 


## Documentation Panel
<img

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/docspanel-graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

Included in Layouts is a documentation panel that’s context-aware, meaning if you click on any component or Tailwind class in the editor, the relevant documentation will populate in your docs panel.
This includes native Layouts, TailwindCSS and HTML docs.

## Preview
<img

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Preview-img.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

Any changes you make within the editor will render real-time in the Preview panel in Layouts. Users can scan the QR code in each panel's tooltip in order to open the window across other devices (mobile, tablet, etc). 

Quite useful to ensure responsiveness across breakpoints when building your projects.

### Project URLs

You can also access each panel from anywhere by it’s URL:

      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>`: Open the preview 
      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/edit`: Open the editor
      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/doc`: Open the contextual doc
      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/code`: See the code output (HTML or React)

## Code export

Whenever you’re ready to export your page, by clicking on the Code panel in navigation, you’ll have the ability to export well-engineered HTML or React (if on Pro Plan) code.
