## The Editor

  The editor is the core programming workspace in Layouts. It is where you'll be primarily living when making code changes. Start programming here to watch your design come to life. We've also built in some ergonomics here via keyboard shortcuts to help speed up your workflow.  

### Slash Menu

By pressing `/` while in the editor, you can access all shadcn/UI components as well as HTML components which you can use to build your project.

### Explainer

When focused on any Tailwind class, use `Shift + Up` or `Shift + Down` to cycle thru corresponding Tailwind classes.

### Reference Implementation

To build even faster in your project, or get quick insight on how to best structure components, type `>>>` after a component tag to paste it’s reference implementation. 


## Documentation Panel

Included in Layouts is a documentation panel that’s context-aware, meaning if you click on any component or Tailwind class in the editor, the relevant documentation will populate in your docs panel.
This includes native Layouts, TailwindCSS and HTML docs.

## Preview

Any changes you make within the editor will render real-time in the Preview panel in Layouts. Users can scan the QR code in each panel's tooltip in order to open the window across other devices (mobile, tablet, etc). 

Quite useful to ensure:
- Responsiveness across breakpoints when building your projects
- Check your design on larger screens
- Or keep your preview on a separate monitor.

Users can also hover over any components in the Preview panel and the Editor will update in real-time to highlight the corresponding code so you don't have to go searching for it.  


### Project URLs

You can also access each panel from anywhere by it’s URL:

      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>`: Open the preview 
      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/edit`: Open the editor
      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/doc`: Open the contextual doc
      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/code`: See the code output (HTML or React)

### Code export

  src="/images/code_export.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/code_export.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

Whenever you’re ready to export your page, by clicking on the Code panel in navigation, you’ll have the ability to copy and paste well-engineered HTML or React code (if on Frontend or Fullstack plans) into your project. 

### NextJS Sync

If on the **Frontend Plan** user's have access to one of our most powerful features, NextJS Sync. With it, users have access to our CLI and are able to sync their Layouts project with a NextJS project locally.

**Benefits include:**
- Automatic updates with your local project 
- Maintain design consistency from prototype to production
- Accelerate your React workflow. Quickly build your interface, than add backend functions in your IDE.
