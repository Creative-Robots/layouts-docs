You figured it out. Layouts is not a finished product polished at every angle.
It’s very raw, a bit buggy. We throwed it out into the wild to get feedback from people like you.

We’d love you to get in touch and tell us how you feel about it. 

Here are a few channels below on how to best reach out:

## Talk to an actual human

### Contact support
Reach out to Layouts.dev support by contacting us directly at help@creative-robots.ai or by clicking the _Contact Support_ button in app. 

**or**

By getting in touch with us on the dedicated _Contact Support_ link on our website.

For syntax questions, the best place to ask is the #syntax channel in our Discord community.

### Community 
We recommend joining the Layouts.dev Discord channel to meet other Layouts users and exchange tips/tricks. 
The whole Layouts team lives in the Discord so it's a great place to ask questions. 

The community is also a great place to report #bugs and share #product-feedback, ask for help while building and to get #help from the team or community.


## Contribute 

If you’re interested in contributing, we’d love to have you onboard!
Here are a few ways:

    **Giving feedback**:
        - Feel free to contribute feedback on our Discord (see above for notes on where to best submit feedback).
    
    **Joining the team**: 
        - We’re a small company looking for funding, but we’ll certainly be hiring very soon. We’d love to get in touch beforehand so we can contact you. Feel free to send us an email at hi@creative-robots.ai
   
    **Investing**: 
        - Money (Capital at Risk): We believe in the power of community investing. We currently have an open SAFE in place for people wanting to invest. Anybody can send funds and you’ll be added to our SAFE as an investor. Works for contributions starting at $5k and beyond.
        - Time: If you don’t have money (like a lot of us) but feel you could contribute time as a team member, we’re super open to talk. We can compensate you with a great pay rate in shares on our SAFE. It’s just shares, but hey, we’re aiming for the stars!
