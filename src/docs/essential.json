It’s very opinionated, tailor-made for Tailwind and filled with features to make your idea to production journey way easier as a developer. We're currently in early beta, so lots of bugs, but we felt it’s important to build in public together with a community. \r\n    \r\n    We’d love to get your feedback!\r\n\r\n## Why use Layouts.dev?\r\n\r\n**A notebook experience for Tailwind+React developers**\r\n\r\nWe love the idea of being able to open up a blank page, write a few lines of code and see the results instantly. \r\nWith Layouts, every page you create gets a unique URL you can share instantly.\r\nAs fun to play with as a Tailwind playground, as shareable as a GitHub Gist.\r\nNo setup, no yarn install, no boilerplate, no deploy. Just play & share.\r\n\r\n**A new way for designers to contribute to code**\r\n\r\nWe've found that by improving the DX in Layouts.dev, it has the potential to be a designer's bridge to the world of coding UI with high-quality, accessible and customizable code. Historically we've felt that drag-and-drop visual builders can constrain creativity vs. a code-focused approach, which means your creativity can truly be limitless.\r\n\r\nLayouts.dev provides the intuitive visuals and frameworks that empower designers to directly build out front-end UI themselves vs. tossing designs over the wall for developers. We've all been there 😮‍💨. For designers familiar with CSS frameworks like Tailwind, Layouts can open up new levels of accessibility to the code layer.\r\n\r\nMatter a fact, we've even used this internally to help speed up the development process by iterating quickly between our designer and developer for UI across Layouts. \r\n\r\n### Concise syntax to help you focus on what matters\r\n<img\r\n  className=\"block dark:hidden\"\r\n  src=\"/images/Syntax_graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Light\"\r\n/>\r\n<img\r\n  className=\"hidden dark:block\"\r\n  src=\"/images/Syntax_graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Dark\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAt first glance, we admit this may look like a bad idea (alert! new programming language!), but we felt we needed something more readable and also way more permissive to ship UIs faster. So we built a DSL (Domain Specific Language) focused on assembling a UI with React+Tailwind.\r\n\r\nIt enables us to generate state-of-the-art React code from a more natural, very approximate input. This allows both for a short syntax using beautiful defaults and a composable syntax giving you very accurate control on the output React code, all while making the code up to 10x smaller and more readable.\r\n\r\n>**Fun fact:** we created this language back in 2021 when trying to make apps using OpenAI's GPT-3. At that time, GPT-3 was so bad at React that we felt building a language for a lower intelligence was necessary. Then we figured out it actually contributed to a nicer DX for humans too, while drastically reducing both generation time and error rates of modern AI LLMs like GPT-4.\r\n\r\n### Live multi-screen, multi-preview of what you're building\r\n\r\nAnybody with a Layouts link can display your preview and see updates as you type.\r\n\r\nSuper useful for building responsive pages.\r\n\r\n### Designed to be keyboard-first for fast iteration of Tailwind classes.\r\n\r\nWe designed Layouts in a way that leans into developer ergonomics, so you can use the keyboard to build quickly. \r\n\r\n### Tons of pre-made components to help you build complex UIs\r\n\r\nEverything from accessible Dialog Boxes, Toggles and Buttons to Auto-Completes. We are huge fans of shadcn/ui, so we wanted to offer the full-library during Private Beta.\r\n\r\nMore component libraries coming soon! 🎉\r\n\r\n### Basically, less context switching all over the place\r\n\r\nLayouts displays contextual documentation when you click into any component, class, prop or attribute. It also fetches icons, illustrations and other image assets for you.\r\n\r\nAnd you don’t need to setup a repository to make it work. **Voilá**\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Helpful Links\r\n\r\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\r\n  <Card title=\"Quickstart\" icon=\"rocket\" href=\"/essentials/introduction\">\r\n    Start building right away.\r\n  </Card>\r\n  <Card title=\"The UI\" icon=\"display\" href=\"/essentials/editor\">\r\n    An orientation of the Layouts UI.\r\n  </Card>\r\n  <Card title=\"The syntax\" icon=\"code\" href=\"/essentials/The syntax\">\r\n    How programming works in Layouts.\r\n  </Card>\r\n  <Card title=\"Help & support\" icon=\"question\" href=\"/essentials/help\">\r\n    Best ways to get in touch.\r\n  </Card>\r\n</CardGroup>\r\n",

Context Menu**\r\n    ```syntax Short Syntax\r\n    /context-menu\r\n     Menu item 1 <Alt 1>\r\n     Menu item 2\r\n          # Label\r\n          Sub-menu item 1 <Shift P>\r\n          ---\r\n          Sub-menu item 2 <Cmd S>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Composable syntax** is what you’ll need when defaults don’t suit you, or if you need to surgically  \r\nchange the style of a specific element within your components.\r\n\r\n    **ex. Context Menu**\r\n    ```syntax Composable\r\n/div Right click here flex h-[150px] w-[300px] items-center justify-center rounded-md border border-dashed text-sm\r\n\t/context-menu w-64 \r\n\t\t/item Back\r\n\t\t/shortcut \r\n\t\t\t⌘\r\n\t/item Forward\r\n\t\t/shortcut ⌘]\r\n\t\t/item Reload\r\n\t\t/shortcut ⌘R\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\n### Custom classes\r\n\r\nWhen you find yourself having to break away from the design system to get your design right, consistent with TailwindCSS, you can use arbitrary values in your `/theme`, `/style` and across individal components.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can add some top-margin to a `/div` by using Tailwind’s square bracket notation to generate a class on any arbitrary value.\r\n\r\nThis works for everything, including things like text colors, font styles, pseudo-elements, and more.\r\n\r\n**ex.**\r\n```syntax Layouts\r\n/div flex flex-row items-center mt-[200px]\r\n  /h1 My avatar\r\n  /avatar https://github.com/shadcn.png\r\n\t\t\t@fallback=\"CN\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Variants\r\n\r\n<video\r\n  autoPlay\r\n  muted\r\n  loop\r\n  playsInline\r\n  className=\"w-full aspect-video\"\r\n  src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ldp5j91ws0nadfobg63la/Variants_Syntax_Layoutsdocs.mp4?rlkey=9t8pjjaf4f28dedk5p1uh55ts&st=6k2bvzg1&dl=0\"\r\n></video>\r\n\r\nMany components in Layouts have an alternative version which can share many of the same visual and behavioral differences. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if you're working with the `/alert` component in Layouts, you can quickly reference it's implementation (using `>>>`) and notice it's variant is set automatically set to `%default`.\r\nTo change a component's variant, you can either type it in manually, or (for ease of use), cycle thru available variants using your `Shift+Up, Shift+down` on your keyboard.\r\n\r\nTo look up a component's available variants, you can reference Layouts documentation via the Docs panel in navigation. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Summary \r\n\r\nAfter the `/component`, you can apply a number of different properties including:\r\n    - Type any Tailwind classes and they’ll be recognized as such. For example, write `bg-indigo-900`\r\n    - Type any other CSS class using the format `.customClassName`\r\n    - Specify variants for components using `%variantName` syntax\r\n    - Use custom classes across your `/theme`, `/style`, or individual components in Layouts like `/p-[24px]`.\r\n    - Add props like `@type=button` or `@title=”Title with spaces”` which will be equivalent to HTML attributes like `<div type=”button” ></div>`\r\n    - Bind a variable to a component by using `$variableName`\r\n    - Any plain text will be recognized as a text-string and placed as a child of the component\r\n\r\n  To summarize, type any valid HTML component and you can use any Tailwind class on it.

Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.\n\n| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |\n| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |\n| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |\n| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |\n| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |\n\nYou can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.\n\nYou need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.\n\n| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |\n| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |\n| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |\n\n## Linking to Pages\n\nYou can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).\n\nLinks to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page \"Text\" in our components section.\n\nRelative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.\n\n## Blockquotes\n\n### Singleline\n\nTo create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.\n\n> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.\n\n```md\n> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.\n```\n\n### Multiline\n\n> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.\n>\n> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.\n\n```md\n> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.\n>\n> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.\n```\n\n### LaTeX\n\nMintlify supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) through the Latex component.\n\n<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>\n\n```md\n<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>\n```\n",

You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```json Regular Navigation\n\"navigation\": [\n    {\n        \"group\": \"Getting Started\",\n        \"pages\": [\"quickstart\"]\n    }\n]\n```\n\n```json Nested Navigation\n\"navigation\": [\n    {\n        \"group\": \"Getting Started\",\n        \"pages\": [\n            \"quickstart\",\n            {\n                \"group\": \"Nested Reference Pages\",\n                \"pages\": [\"nested-reference-page\"]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Folders\n\nSimply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `mint.json`.\n\nFor example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.\n\n<Warning>\n\nYou cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside another folder. Mintlify uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api` folder for internal server calls. A folder name such as `api-reference` would be accepted.\n\n</Warning>\n\n```json Navigation With Folder\n\"navigation\": [\n    {\n        \"group\": \"Group Name\",\n        \"pages\": [\"your-folder/your-page\"]\n    }\n]\n```\n\n## Hidden Pages\n\nMDX files not included in `mint.json` will not show up in the sidebar but are accessible through the search bar and by linking directly to them.\n",

If you want to create a standalone page\n  from the snippet, import the snippet into another file and call it as a\n  component.\n</Note>\n\n### Default export\n\n1. Add content to your snippet file that you want to re-use across multiple\n   locations. Optionally, you can add variables that can be filled in via props\n   when you import the snippet.\n\n```mdx snippets/my-snippet.mdx\nHello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages. My keyword of the\nday is {word}.\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  The content that you want to reuse must be inside the `snippets` directory in\n  order for the import to work.\n</Warning>\n\n2.

Export a variable from your snippet file:\n\n```mdx snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx\nexport const myName = 'my name';\n\nexport const myObject = { fruit: 'strawberries' };\n```\n\n2.

Inside your snippet file, create a component that takes in props by exporting\n   your component in the form of an arrow function.\n\n```mdx snippets/custom-component.mdx\nexport const MyComponent = ({ title }) => (\n  <div>\n    <h1>{title}</h1>\n    <p>... snippet content ...</p>\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  MDX does not compile inside the body of an arrow function. Stick to HTML\n  syntax when you can or use a default export if you need to use MDX.\n</Warning>\n\n2. Import the snippet into your destination file and pass in the props\n\n```mdx destination-file.mdx\n---\ntitle: My title\ndescription: My Description\n---\n\nimport { MyComponent } from '/snippets/custom-component.mdx';\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\n\n<MyComponent title={'Custom title'} />\n```\n",
