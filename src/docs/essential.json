It’s very opinionated, tailor-made for Tailwind and filled with features to make your idea to production journey way easier as a developer. We're currently in early beta, so lots of bugs, but we felt it’s important to build in public together with a community. \r\n    \r\n    We’d love to get your feedback!\r\n\r\n## Why use Layouts.dev?\r\n\r\n**A notebook experience for Tailwind+React developers**\r\n\r\nWe love the idea of being able to open up a blank page, write a few lines of code and see the results instantly. \r\nWith Layouts, every page you create gets a unique URL you can share instantly.\r\nAs fun to play with as a Tailwind playground, as shareable as a GitHub Gist.\r\nNo setup, no yarn install, no boilerplate, no deploy. Just play & share.\r\n\r\n**A new way for designers to contribute to code**\r\n\r\nWe've found that by improving the DX in Layouts.dev, it has the potential to be a designer's bridge to the world of coding UI with high-quality, accessible and customizable code. Historically we've felt that drag-and-drop visual builders can constrain creativity vs. a code-focused approach, which means your creativity can truly be limitless.\r\n\r\nLayouts.dev provides the intuitive visuals and frameworks that empower designers to directly build out front-end UI themselves vs. tossing designs over the wall for developers. We've all been there 😮‍💨. For designers familiar with CSS frameworks like Tailwind, Layouts can open up new levels of accessibility to the code layer.\r\n\r\nMatter a fact, we've even used this internally to help speed up the development process by iterating quickly between our designer and developer for UI across Layouts. \r\n\r\n### Concise syntax to help you focus on what matters\r\n<img\r\n  className=\"block dark:hidden\"\r\n  src=\"/images/Syntax_graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Light\"\r\n/>\r\n<img\r\n  className=\"hidden dark:block\"\r\n  src=\"/images/Syntax_graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Dark\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAt first glance, we admit this may look like a bad idea (alert! new programming language!), but we felt we needed something more readable and also way more permissive to ship UIs faster. So we built a DSL (Domain Specific Language) focused on assembling a UI with React+Tailwind.\r\n\r\nIt enables us to generate state-of-the-art React code from a more natural, very approximate input. This allows both for a short syntax using beautiful defaults and a composable syntax giving you very accurate control on the output React code, all while making the code up to 10x smaller and more readable.\r\n\r\n>**Fun fact:** we created this language back in 2021 when trying to make apps using OpenAI's GPT-3. At that time, GPT-3 was so bad at React that we felt building a language for a lower intelligence was necessary. Then we figured out it actually contributed to a nicer DX for humans too, while drastically reducing both generation time and error rates of modern AI LLMs like GPT-4.\r\n\r\n### Live multi-screen, multi-preview of what you're building\r\n\r\nAnybody with a Layouts link can display your preview and see updates as you type.\r\n\r\nSuper useful for building responsive pages.\r\n\r\n### Designed to be keyboard-first for fast iteration of Tailwind classes.\r\n\r\nWe designed Layouts in a way that leans into developer ergonomics, so you can use the keyboard to build quickly. \r\n\r\n### Tons of pre-made components to help you build complex UIs\r\n\r\nEverything from accessible Dialog Boxes, Toggles and Buttons to Auto-Completes. We are huge fans of shadcn/ui, so we wanted to offer the full-library during Private Beta.\r\n\r\nMore component libraries coming soon! 🎉\r\n\r\n### Basically, less context switching all over the place\r\n\r\nLayouts displays contextual documentation when you click into any component, class, prop or attribute. It also fetches icons, illustrations and other image assets for you.\r\n\r\nAnd you don’t need to setup a repository to make it work. **Voilá**\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Helpful Links\r\n\r\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\r\n  <Card title=\"Quickstart\" icon=\"rocket\" href=\"/essentials/introduction\">\r\n    Start building right away.\r\n  </Card>\r\n  <Card title=\"The UI\" icon=\"display\" href=\"/essentials/editor\">\r\n    An orientation of the Layouts UI.\r\n  </Card>\r\n  <Card title=\"The syntax\" icon=\"code\" href=\"/essentials/The syntax\">\r\n    How programming works in Layouts.\r\n  </Card>\r\n  <Card title=\"Help & support\" icon=\"question\" href=\"/essentials/help\">\r\n    Best ways to get in touch.\r\n  </Card>\r\n</CardGroup>\r\n",

It is where you'll be primarily living when making code changes. Start programming here to watch your design come to life. We've also built in some ergonomics here via keyboard shortcuts to help speed up your workflow.  \r\n\r\n### Slash Menu\r\n <img\r\n  className=\"block dark:hidden\"\r\n  src=\"/images/slash_graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Light\"\r\n/>\r\n<img\r\n  className=\"hidden dark:block\"\r\n  src=\"/images/slash_graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Dark\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nBy pressing `/` while in the editor, you can access all shadcn/UI components as well as HTML components which you can use to build your project.\r\n\r\n### Explainer\r\n <img\r\n  className=\"block dark:hidden\"\r\n  src=\"/images/explainer_graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Light\"\r\n/>\r\n<img\r\n  className=\"hidden dark:block\"\r\n  src=\"/images/explainer_graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Dark\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWhen focused on any Tailwind class, use `Shift + Up` or `Shift + Down` to cycle thru corresponding Tailwind classes.\r\n\r\n### Reference Implementation\r\n<img height=\"full\" src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/08cmlwagf7r4e9xe2fxrn/ref_graphic.gif?rlkey=pkgo5vbxq839vl1x9d7mtzazq&dl=0\" />\r\nTo build even faster in your project, or get quick insight on how to best structure components, type `>>>` after a component tag to paste it’s reference implementation. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation Panel\r\n<img\r\n  className=\"block dark:hidden\"\r\n  src=\"/images/docspanel-graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Light\"\r\n/>\r\n<img\r\n  className=\"hidden dark:block\"\r\n  src=\"/images/docspanel-graphic.svg\"\r\n  alt=\"Hero Dark\"\r\n/>\r\n\r\nIncluded in Layouts is a documentation panel that’s context-aware, meaning if you click on any component or Tailwind class in the editor, the relevant documentation will populate in your docs panel.\r\nThis includes native Layouts, TailwindCSS and HTML docs.\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\n<video\r\n  autoPlay\r\n  muted\r\n  loop\r\n  playsInline\r\n  className=\"w-full aspect-video\"\r\n  src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/egivd8wkcsvbh7s7cja5t/Preview_UI_Layoutsdocs.mp4?rlkey=zkyyzy381zxui9z407llcmz19&st=0yoq2ks5&dl=0\"\r\n></video>\r\n\r\nAny changes you make within the editor will render real-time in the Preview panel in Layouts. Users can scan the QR code in each panel's tooltip in order to open the window across other devices (mobile, tablet, etc). \r\n\r\nQuite useful to ensure responsiveness across breakpoints when building your projects.\r\n\r\n### Project URLs\r\n\r\nYou can also access each panel from anywhere by it’s URL:\r\n\r\n      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>`: Open the preview \r\n      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/edit`: Open the editor\r\n      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/doc`: Open the contextual doc\r\n      - `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/code`: See the code output (HTML or React)\r\n\r\n## Code export\r\n\r\nWhenever you’re ready to export your page, by clicking on the Code panel in navigation, you’ll have the ability to export well-engineered HTML or React (if on Pro Plan) code.\r\n",

          "MdxContent": "\r\n## Intro\r\n\r\nThe syntax we use in Layouts is different from HTML or JSX. See why [here](essentials/What%20is%20Layouts#concise-syntax-to-help-you-focus-on-what-matters).\r\nFear not! We decided to keep as close to the original, so it works just the same. 😎\r\n\r\nHere’s what you need to know:\r\n\r\n### Tabs and `/` instead of XML components.\r\n\r\n  Instead of writing: \r\n  ``` HTML HTML\r\n  <div class=\"bg-indigo-100\" >\r\n\t<button>\r\n\t\tHello\r\n\t</button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nYou write: \r\n```syntax Layouts\r\n/div bg-indigo-100\r\n\t/button Hello\r\n```\r\n### Works with (included) React components or any HTML component.\r\n\r\nAny HTML component like `/div` or `/section` will work like: \r\n\r\n```syntax Layouts\r\n/div Hello!\r\n```\r\n### Tailwind classes are first-class citizens\r\n\r\nAny Tailwind class you input will be detected and used as a class name for the component on the same line: \r\n```syntax Layouts\r\n/button bg-indigo-100\r\n```\r\nIs the same as: \r\n```HTML HTML\r\n<button className=\"bg-indigo-100\" />\r\n```\r\n<Info>Tailwind classes can live on the same line as the `/component` or as a child of the component, on a line \r\nwith only Tailwind classes.</Info>\r\n\r\n**Here's an example:**\r\n```syntax Layouts\r\n/button \r\n   bg-indigo-100 font-medium text-xl \r\n   This works too\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Props with `@`\r\n\r\nUse:\r\n```syntax Layouts\r\n/button @onClick={() => alert ('Haha!')}\r\n```\r\nInstead of:\r\n```HTML HTML\r\n<button onClick={()  => alert('Haha!')} />\r\n```\r\n<Info>Props can live either on the same line as the `/component`, or nested as a child with one prop per line.</Info>\r\n\r\n**Here's an example:**\r\n```syntax Layouts\r\n  /button \r\n  @onClick={()  => alert('Haha!')}\r\n  This works too\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n  \r\nLayouts uses a simplified syntax for using variables with components.\r\n- All variable names are prefixed with `$`\r\n- Adding a variable name on a component line binds the variable to the component\r\n- Adding the variable name in props or as content uses the variable value there\r\n\r\n**Here's an example:**\r\n```\r\n  /input $name What’s your name?  \r\n  /h1 Hello $name !\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also load data from external sources into variables\r\nSee the specific section about data sources [here](essentials/datasources)\r\n\r\n  **ex. Data Source**\r\n    ```syntax Layouts\r\n    /data $movies = mock://movies with title and poster\r\n    /div w-full overflow-x-scroll\r\n    \t/hstack bg-slate-950 gap-5 p-4 text-white items-start w-fit\r\n    \t\t/foreach $movies\r\n    \t\t\t/vstack gap-3 %center justify-start\r\n    \t\t\t\t/div w-32\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t/aspect-ratio %video-portrait overflow-hidden\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t/image $item.poster size-full object-cover rounded hover:scale-105 cursor-pointer\r\n    \t\t\t\t/center $item.title w-full text-center text-sm\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Short vs. Composable Syntax\r\nOn one hand, a great developer experience should enable you to build something at the speed of light.\r\nOn the other hand, it should give you unobstructed control over the tiniest details of each component.\r\nTo give you both, most components built in Layouts are usable with two types of syntax.\r\n\r\nThe short syntax is what you will use when you need great default and little customization.\r\nIt’s the syntax we use most of the time in reference implementations.\r\nIt’s made to be as easy to use as MDX and super intuitive _(hopefully...feedback welcome!)_\r\n    \r\n    **ex. Context Menu**\r\n    ```syntax Short Syntax\r\n    /context-menu\r\n     Menu item 1 <Alt 1>\r\n     Menu item 2\r\n          # Label\r\n          Sub-menu item 1 <Shift P>\r\n          ---\r\n          Sub-menu item 2 <Cmd S>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Composable syntax** is what you’ll need when defaults don’t suit you, or if you need to surgically  \r\nchange the style of a specific element within your components.\r\n\r\n    **ex. Context Menu**\r\n    ```syntax Composable\r\n/div Right click here flex h-[150px] w-[300px] items-center justify-center rounded-md border border-dashed text-sm\r\n\t/context-menu w-64 \r\n\t\t/item Back\r\n\t\t/shortcut \r\n\t\t\t⌘\r\n\t/item Forward\r\n\t\t/shortcut ⌘]\r\n\t\t/item Reload\r\n\t\t/shortcut ⌘R\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\n### Custom classes\r\n\r\nWhen you find yourself having to break away from the design system to get your design right, consistent with TailwindCSS, you can use arbitrary values in your `/theme`, `/style` and across individal components.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can add some top-margin to a `/div` by using Tailwind’s square bracket notation to generate a class on any arbitrary value.\r\n\r\nThis works for everything, including things like text colors, font styles, pseudo-elements, and more.\r\n\r\n**ex.**\r\n```syntax Layouts\r\n/div flex flex-row items-center mt-[200px]\r\n  /h1 My avatar\r\n  /avatar https://github.com/shadcn.png\r\n\t\t\t@fallback=\"CN\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Variants\r\n\r\n<video\r\n  autoPlay\r\n  muted\r\n  loop\r\n  playsInline\r\n  className=\"w-full aspect-video\"\r\n  src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ldp5j91ws0nadfobg63la/Variants_Syntax_Layoutsdocs.mp4?rlkey=9t8pjjaf4f28dedk5p1uh55ts&st=6k2bvzg1&dl=0\"\r\n></video>\r\n\r\nMany components in Layouts have an alternative version which can share many of the same visual and behavioral differences. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if you're working with the `/alert` component in Layouts, you can quickly reference it's implementation (using `>>>`) and notice it's variant is set automatically set to `%default`.\r\nTo change a component's variant, you can either type it in manually, or (for ease of use), cycle thru available variants using your `Shift+Up, Shift+down` on your keyboard.\r\n\r\nTo look up a component's available variants, you can reference Layouts documentation via the Docs panel in navigation. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Summary \r\n\r\nAfter the `/component`, you can apply a number of different properties including:\r\n    - Type any Tailwind classes and they’ll be recognized as such. For example, write `bg-indigo-900`\r\n    - Type any other CSS class using the format `.customClassName`\r\n    - Specify variants for components using `%variantName` syntax\r\n    - Use custom classes across your `/theme`, `/style`, or individual components in Layouts like `/p-[24px]`.\r\n    - Add props like `@type=button` or `@title=”Title with spaces”` which will be equivalent to HTML attributes like `<div type=”button” ></div>`\r\n    - Bind a variable to a component by using `$variableName`\r\n    - Any plain text will be recognized as a text-string and placed as a child of the component\r\n\r\n  To summarize, type any valid HTML component and you can use any Tailwind class on it.
