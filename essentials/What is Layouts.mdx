It's helpful to get an understanding as to how features work in Layouts and explain why building Tailwind works the way it does. Layouts is web editor for building TailwindCSS projects, built for a realtime, multi-screen and multi-device development experience.

## The editor 

 <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/editor_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/editor_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

  The editor is the life-blood of Layouts. It is where you'll be primarily living when building projects and making code changes.
  Write both HTML and apply TailwindCSS classes here to start watching your design come to life. Within the editor live keyboard shortcuts to help speed up your workflow.  

### Slash Menu
 <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/slash_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/slash_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

By pressing `/` while in the editor, you can access all shadcn/UI components as well as HTML components which you can use to build your project.

### Explainer
 <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/explainer_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/explainer_graphic.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

When focused on any Tailwind class, use `Shift + Up` or `Shift + Down` to cycle thru corresponding Tailwind classes.

### Reference Implementation

Type `>>>` after a component tag to paste it’s reference implementation.


When focused on any Tailwind class, use `Shift + Up` or `Shift + Down` to cycle thru corresponding Tailwind classes.

### Asset Libraries
We've included a number of different asset libraries available to users including icons, illustrations, logos and images.
 
 **Examples**:
  - **✅** `/icon A bear` will find you the closest icon we have to a bear
  - **✅** `/illustration %3d Thumb up emoji` will find you a thumb up emoji in 3d
  - **✅** `/logo Stripe` will find you the Stripe logo
  - **✅** `/image <libraryName>:SpaceX astronauts` will find you (from Unsplash, Google images, etc.) or generate (Dalle-E, Stable diffusion, OpenJourney, etc) an image of SpaceX astronauts (eg `/image openjourney:SpaceX astronauts`)



## Documentation Panel

Included in Layouts is a documentation panel that’s context-aware, meaning if you click on any component or Tailwind class in the editor, the relevant documentation will populate in your docs panel.
This includes native Layouts, TailwindCSS and HTML docs.

## Preview

Any changes you make within the editor will render real-time in the Preview panel in Layouts. Open your Layouts URL on any device or any screen and it’s content will change live as you make changes to your code. Project URLs work like this:

- `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>`: See the page
- `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/edit`: Open the editor for the page
- `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/doc`: Open the contextual doc
- `https://layouts.dev/<pageId>/code`: See the code output (HTML or React)

## Code export

Whenever you’re ready to export your page, by clicking on the Code panel in navigation, you’ll have the ability to export well-engineered HTML or React (if on Pro Plan) code.
