Layouts is the notebook experience for building TailwindCSS projects. 

What's primarily different compared to your standard HTML experience, is that in Layouts, we use a concise syntax to help you code faster, by removing all the code-fluff.

This guide will walk you through how to start building Tailwind UIs and get the most out of Layouts.

## The basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Layouts Syntax" icon="code">
  We use a more concise version of HTML for building in Layouts. This allows for ultimate flexibility and creativity in the editor. 
  Components are represented by a line beginning with `/componentName`. We use tabulations to structure the components of the page into a tree of parent and children components. 
  
  In the example below, both `/button` and `/div` are components.`/button` is the child of `/div` and therefore it will be placed inside it. 
  
  Instead of writing: 
  ```
  <div class="bg-indigo-100" >
	<button>
		Hello
	</button>
</div>
```
You write: 
```
/div bg-indigo-100
	/button Hello
```

After the `/componentName`, you can apply a number of different properties including:
    - Type any Tailwind classes and they’ll be recognized as such. For example, write `bg-indigo-900`
    - Type any other CSS class using the format `.customClassName`
    - Specify variants for components using `%variantName` syntax
    - Add attributes like `@type=button` or `@title=”Title with spaces”` which will be equivalent to HTML attributes like `<div type=”button” ></div>`
    - Bind a variable to a component by using `$variableName`
    - Any plain text will be recognized as a text-string and placed as a child of the component

To summarize, type any valid HTML component and you can use any Tailwind class on it. Style away!

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keyboard actions" icon="keyboard">
     - Type `/` to see a slash menu and search for components
     - Select any Tailwind class or variant name and press `Shift + Up` or `Shift + Down` to see the other possible values. 
     - Write `>>>` after a component tag to paste it's reference implementation. 

    Once you're in your Project's dashboard, you'll navigate to the Actions panel to generate a new 'action'. In the the input field, describe what you want your button to do, and AI will take care of all the complex back-end programming.
  </Accordion>

   <Accordion title="Pre-made components" icon="bolt">
    By pressing `/`, you’ll find all [shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components available in a single keystroke. And a lot more are coming.
    For example, typing `/dropdown-menu` will grab the shadcn/UI 'dropdown menu' component. By adding `>>>` you can generate the reference implementation and edit from there. 

    Example with reference implementation: 
    ```
    /button Open menu
    	/dropdown-menu w-56
    		# My account
    		---
    		Profile <Shift + Cmd + P>
    			/icon Single user
    		Billing <Cmd + B>
    			/icon Credit card
    		Settings <Cmd + S>
    		Keyboard shortcuts <Cmd + K>
    		---
    		Team
    			/icon Multiple users
    		Invite users w-40
    			/icon Add a user
    			Email
    			Message 
    				/icon Chat bubble
    			---
    			More...
    				/icon Plus in circle
    		New Team <Cmd + T>
    			/icon Plus
    		---
    		GitHub
    		Support 
    			/icon life saving
    		API @disabled
    			/icon Cloud
    		---
    		Log out <Shift + Cmd + Q>
      ```

    </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Asset Libraries" icon="icons">
 We've included a number of different asset libraries available to users including icons, illustrations, logos and images.
 
 Examples:
  - **✅** `/icon A bear` will find you the closest icon we have to a bear
  - **✅** `/illustration %3d Thumb up emoji` will find you a thumb up emoji in 3d
  - **✅** `/logo Stripe` will find you the Stripe logo
  - **✅** `/image <libraryName>:SpaceX astronauts` will find you (from Unsplash, Google images, etc.) or generate (Dalle-E, Stable diffusion, OpenJourney, etc) an image of SpaceX astronauts (eg `/image openjourney:SpaceX astronauts`)

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Exporting your code" icon="upload">
    Check out **Deploying Buttons** for more details on how to publish across specific platforms.

    **For basic instructions to setup Buttons.dev on any no-code platform:**

    Most platforms enable you to add scripts in the project's or page's settings. Add this script to your header tag: 
    ```
    <script src="https://cdn.buttons.dev?pid=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>"></script>

    ```

    If you don't have a project ID, just add ```<script src="https://cdn.buttons.dev"></script>``` and the platform will give you the right line to paste when you click on your buttons.

## Managing actions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dashboard" icon="sidebar">
Once an action is created, you can see it in your dashboard on https://app.buttons.dev. You can browse thru all of your projects there, and see all the actions generated for each project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Access to code" icon="code">
   Within your Actions panel, you have the the option to edit your code manually, chat with an AI to improve it, or even ask a human developer to make modifications.
  </Accordion>

   <Accordion title="Monitoring" icon="network-wired">
    It's helpful to understand which calls have been made to your action and how it responded.
