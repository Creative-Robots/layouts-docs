## General tips 

We make programming in Layouts a huge focus of our work, this allows for us to simplify DX by making the syntax more human friendly.

We use a more concise version of HTML for building in Layouts. This allows for ultimate flexibility and creativity in the editor. Components are represented by a line beginning with `/componentName`. We use tabulations to structure the components of the page into a tree of parent and children components.

After the `/componentName`, you can apply a number of different properties including:
    - Type any Tailwind classes and they’ll be recognized as such. For example, write `bg-indigo-900`
    - Type any other CSS class using the format `.customClassName`
    - Specify variants for components using `%variantName` syntax
    - Add attributes like `@type=button` or `@title=”Title with spaces”` which will be equivalent to HTML attributes like `<div type=”button” ></div>`
    - Bind a variable to a component by using `$variableName`
    - Any plain text will be recognized as a text-string and placed as a child of the component

### Examples

**From this** (_Standard HTML_)
```
<Dialog>
  <DialogTrigger asChild>
     <Button variant="outline">Edit Profile</Button>
  </DialogTrigger>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogHeader>
      <DialogTitle>Edit profile</DialogTitle>
    </DialogHeader>
	  Dialog content here
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```
**To this** (_Layouts Syntax_)
```
/button %outline Edit Profile
	/dialog Edit Profile
		Dialog content here
```
